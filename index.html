<h3>What to look for?</h3>
<hr>
<p>The key to good improvement is to have a great Rubik's cube. Of course, practice is vital, however the perfect cube for you will make it much easier.</p>
<p>The <b>three best qualities</b> to look for in a 3x3 cube are the <b>corner cutting</b>, the <b>speed of consecutive moves</b> and the <b>unexpected lock-ups</b>. These are the main characteristics to look at when you decide to buy a Rubik's cube. The following four are <strong>secondary characteristics</strong> and should also be considered:
  The <b>tension of the screws</b>, the <b>lubrication</b>, the <b>stickers</b> and the <b>size</b>. All these secondary qualities, however can be improved and are variable.</p>

<h3>Rubik's</h3>
<hr>
<p>Let's start our list with the Rubik's brand, even if it's not considered to have the best quality and this is why it's not a common speedcube. They have always been criticized in the speedcubing community for producing relatively poor quality products. Rubik's has always been in a comfortable position thanks to its name and they never had to
  come up with revolutionary ideas to remain in business while the other brands in our list present something new from time to time.</p>
<p>Rubik's has its own Speed Cube with coloured plastic tiles and the pieces are built around a spherical core design which allows fast movement, good corner cutting and it doesn't pop. However this puzzle is too fast and the centre piece is locking on reverse corner cuts which can ruin the solve.</p>

<h3>Yj</h3>
<hr>
<p>YJ, as a company, has existed for quite some time. They released some basic speedcubes back in 2010 to compete with the then-popular Alpha puzzles (even collaborating with them to create a speedcube under both their names). MoYu, a very highly recognised brand that makes professional speedcubes is a sub-brand of YJ. In 2012, YJ created MoYu as
   a platform for designers to send their ideas to YJ and in turn receive some of the profits.</p>
<p> YJ still sell puzzles under their own name today despite the immense popularity of MoYu puzzles. These are normally budget cubes and tend to be poorer in performance than their counterparts.</p>

<h3>MoYu</h3>
<hr>
<a href="http://moyucube.com/en/"><img src="C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\Sanjay\ProtoSem\UI UX\sanjay_cube\images\moyu_logo.png" alt="MoYu"></a>
<p>MoYu is one of the best known puzzle manufacturers to date. They focus on producing the best speedcubes for the community, and their cubes have been used in several currently standing World Records.</p>
<p>Along with the production of WCA puzzles, they also produce some other twisty puzzles. There are several different types, all the way from shape mods such as the Fisher Cube to larger puzzles such as the current largest mass produced NxN puzzle (the 13x13).</p>
<p>Despite being known for producing speedcubes, MoYu's cubes are of excellent quality and are highly recommended to all puzzlers, speedcuber or not.
Other than some of the original speedcube brands from several years ago (the Alpha series, DaYan etc.), MoYu is one of the only companies that has been able to survive and thrive despite the intense competition in the speedcube market. Companies such as Gans and QiYi are taking back the 3x3 market from the overall dominance that MoYu once had,
 but their monopoly on larger puzzles is still very much alive.</p>

<br></br>
<h3 >Gans</h3>
<hr>
<p>Gans are currently the best competition for MoYu (excluding the Valk 3, whose popularity increase thanks to the World Record has yet to be seen fully).</b>
<p>They produce only 3x3 speedcubes, which have very specific designs that are very unique to the brand. Some of the older puzzles (such as the Gans 357) weren’t the best cubes but with the release of the Gans 356 and current average World Record holder Feliks’ Zemdegs choice to use the Gans 356 as his main puzzle, Gans has become a force to
be reckoned with. They are still releasing new puzzles and are starting to explore new ways of improving speedcubes, including set tension springs to provide a more stable puzzle.</p>

<h3>Shengshou</h3>
<hr>
<a href= "https://www.cubelelo.com/shengshou"><img src="C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\Sanjay\ProtoSem\UI UX\sanjay_cube\images\shengshou_logo.png" alt="Shengshou"></a>
<p>Shengshou are like the DaYan of big cubes. They were one of the first companies to produce bigger cubes such as the 8x8, 9x9 and 10x10. They were also the go-to choice for 4x4 and 5x5 speedcubes before MoYu came around. Their puzzles were and still are loved by most puzzlers, simply due to their all-round ability to perform when needed.
   They fixed some major issues that existed with previous brands, such as instability and popping. If you are a puzzler and need a reliable cube of any size or type, you should always check to see if Shengshou sell it before looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>Shengshou have held all big cube records in the past, and some of the fastest cubers in the world still use modded Shengshou puzzles and achieve astonishing times with them. Shengshou puzzles always come pre-lubricated, so you never have to worry about a cube being too stiff to turn when you first get it.</p>
